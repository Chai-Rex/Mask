  DialogText:
  - Afraid not dear. We do however have AR-15s, TAC-50s, claymores, a few M1 Abrams,
    3 F-16 jets, and nuclear subs stationed at the 2 nearest ports.
  - You know... the basics. [emphasis]OOH![/emphasis] I did also get word that my
    engineers have been making progress on a recreation of the Schwerer Gustav, but
    that ones just for fun
  - '[shake]*Ahem*[/shake] I may have gotten a bit carried away there. Please forget
    you heard any of that...'
  - Anyways I certainly don't have any of these drawer guns you are talking about,
    that would be ridiculous
